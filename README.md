# Mantle — Whale Surf Tracker

Real-time detector for **single transfers ≥ 500 ETH** on Mantle — the BitDAO-backed, hyper-efficient L2.

Mantle has sub-cent fees and 1-second finality.  
So when someone moves 500+ ETH here —  
they’re not here to trade pennies.

They’re here to **own the wave**.

## Run

```bash
python mantle_whale_surf.py
